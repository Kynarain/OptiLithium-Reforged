# Names every Lithium mixin that touches BlockEntity (class_2586) and, separately, the candidates that inject into
# its CONSTRUCTOR. The second list is the interesting one.
#
# The target name is a PARAMETER because the namespace changes across the versions this project covers:
#   obfuscated  (1.20 - 1.21.11) : -Target net/minecraft/class_2586            (the default)
#   unobfuscated (26.1.2+)       : -Target net/minecraft/world/level/block/entity/BlockEntity
# Passing the wrong one does not error - it simply finds nothing - so a run that reports "mixins naming the target:
# 0" against a jar you know contains some is a sign the namespace is wrong, not that the jar is clean.
#
# Why: OptiFabric rewrites vanilla classes before Mixin sees them. On a class whose constructor it rewrites, a
# Lithium @Inject aimed at that constructor has no target left to bind to, and Mixin aborts the transformation of
# the whole class ("Delegate constructor lookup failed for @Inject target"). Because a mixin failure is fatal, one
# such mixin takes the client down - the fix is to disable exactly the group it belongs to, in lithium.properties,
# rather than to edit any bytecode.
