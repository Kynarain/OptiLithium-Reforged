# Launches one release into a world with an ARBITRARY mod set, for testing a patched Lithium next to OptiFabric.
#
# Why a second launcher rather than a flag on the OptiLithium one: that harness runs a fixed mod list (its own jar
# plus OptiFine plus the stock Lithium) and lives in the OptiLithium repository, which is on hold. This one is
# given its mods, so the same world load and the same evidence standard are used to compare
# patched-Lithium + OptiFabric against anything else, without editing the other project.
#
# It deliberately reuses the OptiLithium rig's LAUNCHER (test\launch.ps1 - profile resolution, natives, argfile,
# quick play) and its WORLD, and reproduces the checks that make a result trustworthy: the game directory is
# deleted and the delete is verified, only files written by this run are read, and the shader pack is installed.

# --- stop the client, with two independent criteria ---

# The ownership check that used to be the ONLY way out of here can never succeed, and that is measured rather than
# suspected: it required the tag to appear on the client's command line, but the client is started as
# `java.exe @<game dir>\java-args.txt` - the tag is one line INSIDE that argfile, so the command line never carries
# it. The OptiLithium launcher states this above its own `$markers` loop, and a process started the same way
# reproduces it exactly: the command line contains the argfile path and does not contain the tag.
#
# Consequence: the client outlived every run. One sweep left 11 clients alive at ~1.5 GB each for nineteen hours,
# and NOTHING about those runs looked wrong, because the verdict is read from the log rather than from the process.
# The first symptom showed up on the NEXT run: a game directory that could not be cleared.
#
# So the client is stopped by:
#
#   1. rig.pid plus the tag (kept: precise whenever it CAN match), and
#   2. anything whose command line names THIS game directory - the same criterion the pre-launch cleanup above
#      already trusts, and the marker the launcher itself recommends (the argfile path is unique per game dir).
#      Only a client started for this run can match: the directory is unique per run and shared with nothing.
