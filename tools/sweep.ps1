# A pipeline, NOT @($script:Releases.Keys): wrapping a collection in the array subexpression operator keeps the
# collection as a SINGLE element, so @($coll).Count is 1 and the loop below would run once with the whole
# dictionary as its "release". Piping forces enumeration. That mistake is why this script first announced
# "sweep of 1 release(s)" and then tried to patch a file called
# "System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary".
# The value is sanitised rather than trusted, because a caller can hand this script a STRINGIFIED collection:
# an OrderedDictionary interpolated into a command line arrives as the literal text
# "System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary", which is not a release name and would otherwise be looked
# up as one. Anything that is not a plausible release name is discarded, and an empty result falls back to the
# whole table.
# The -Releases parameter is NOT used to build this list, and that is a workaround with a measured cause.
#
# This project is driven from a harness that expands "$name" references inside the COMMAND TEXT before the
# command runs, so any appearance of the release table's name in an argument is replaced by that object cast to
# a string. The symptom was unmistakable: with the table written as "$script:Releases", the parameter arrived
# holding the literal text "System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary" - and a debug Write-Host that
# merely MENTIONED the table was enough to cause it, which is how the cause was found.
#
# So selection is by prefix instead: -Only 1.21 narrows the sweep to the releases whose name starts with it,
# and nothing in the invocation has to name a variable.
