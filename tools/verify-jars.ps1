# Checks every patched jar in out\ against what the patch is SUPPOSED to have changed, and against upstream.
#
# Three independent claims are verified for each release:
#
#   1. `breaks` is gone from fabric.mod.json            - the loader conflict this project exists to remove
#   2. the release's mixin groups are set to false      - and NOTHING ELSE was flipped, which is checked by
#                                                         diffing against the upstream jar's own default file
#   3. the licence file and the provenance record are present and untouched
#
# Claim 2 is the one worth automating. It is not enough to see the right lines present: a patch that also flipped
# unrelated groups would still pass a "does it contain mixin.x=false" test while quietly disabling optimisation
# the user never asked for. Comparing against upstream makes the change provably minimal - additive only.
